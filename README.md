# Global Trade Analysis

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring global trade dynamics across the US, EU, UK, and BRICS nations. It examines trade volumes, regional variations, trading partnerships, trade compositions, and their correlations with economic indicators using Python and SQL.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project aimed at unraveling the intricate dynamics of global trade amidst shifting geopolitical landscapes. Using data science techniques, we investigate trade patterns, regional variations, trading partnerships, trade compositions, and their relationships with economic indicators.

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data was cleaned and transformed using the preprocessing script. It ensures the dataset is free from missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. The script standardizes data types, handles missing values, and performs necessary feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.

### 2. **Analysis**:
   - Trade data was queried to calculate key metrics, such as trade volume, country-specific trade patterns, and seasonal trends. The analysis was conducted through Python scripts and SQL queries, exploring various insights related to global trade.

### 3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizations were generated to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in global trade. Scripts in the `visualization/` folder created charts and plots, such as time series, bar charts, and heatmaps, to provide a clear understanding of the trade data.
